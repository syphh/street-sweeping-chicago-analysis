# Spatial data visualization over time of street sweeping zones
 
The goal of this project was to visualize, for each day of the street sweeping period, which zones were concerned in Chicago  
The dataset was pulled from the official Chicago website  
The visualization was made using pandas, geopandas, and folium, then exported as an HTML file that is hosted on tiiny.host
